# Twitter Live-Feed Sentiment Analysis
This code analyzes the live twitter feed about a subject of interest (I chose Maple Leafs because I love their NHL team), visualizes the tweets in the form of a word-cloud and shows the sentiment reflected by the users in their tweets. There is also a polarity vs. subjectivity comparison plot for all tweets.
